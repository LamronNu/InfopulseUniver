We hope you enjoyed Week 4 and that it renewed your interest in British literature.
How ‘green’ are you? That’s the question we’ll ask at the start of this week — what do you do to protect the environment?
We’ll then move on to a video about the Eden Project in Cornwall and its work to protect some endangered species.
In the Language Focus, we’ll look at an interesting little word before moving on to a discussion of the environmental challenges facing your country.
We’re looking forward to another great week of your comments. If you didn’t find time to complete the previous weeks, you can catch up easily by starting at Week 1.
Following the educators and reading their comments from previous weeks is a good way to find answers to any problems you meet as you work through the course.
I hope you enjoy it.
Chris Cavey,
Lead Educator
